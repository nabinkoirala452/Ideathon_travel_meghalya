          Located near Cherrapunjee (Sohra), the <strong className="font-semibold text-BaseColor">Mawmluh Cave</strong> is not only a natural wonder but also a site of immense global significance. It is renowned for its spectacular stalactite and stalagmite formations and its deep pools.
          It stretches for approximately <strong className="font-semibold text-BaseColor">7 km</strong>, making it one of the longest caves in India. The cave is famous for its historical link to a massive geological event.
        </p>
        <p>
          A stalagmite within the cave holds definitive geological proof of a major climate event that occurred about <strong className="font-semibold text-BaseColor">4,200 years ago</strong>. This event led to a massive and abrupt drought that significantly impacted human civilizations around the world, from Mesopotamia to Egypt. The geological epoch marking this event is named the <strong className="font-semibold text-BaseColor">Meghalayan Age</strong>, taking its name from the very state where this evidence was found.
